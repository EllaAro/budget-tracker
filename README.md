# Budget Tracker
## Description
> Need to keep track of your budget? No worries, this app is meant just for that! Enter your incomes and expenses and the app will calculate your current balance based on your inputs.
## Technology Wise
This mini-project was created purely on client-site, using `React`. 
Each of the components are purely functional components (usage of React hooks).
For maintaining state between pages/components `React Redux` is used.
